# Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2

## Experiment 1: Application using JPA

#### [Link to code](https://github.com/oddhus/DAT250-experiment2-jpa)

#### Technical problems

I first had some errors while trying to run my main method. After a lot of struggling, I found out that I was running my database in a seperate command window. My application was therefore not able to connect.

#### Inspecting the database

It is possible to inspect the database by opening the derby interactive scripting tool ij and use SQL.
