# Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2

## Experiment 1: Application using JPA

#### [Link to code](https://github.com/oddhus/DAT250-experiment2-jpa)

#### Technical problems

I wasn't able to connect by just following the guide linked in the assignment. The problem was that the newest version of the derby-db need some additional jars, specifically derby.jar, derbyshared.jar and derbytools.jar.

#### Inspecting the database

It is possible to inspect the database by opening the derby interactive scripting tool ij and use SQL.
