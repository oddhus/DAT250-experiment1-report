# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1

## Installation
Too manage my installations I use [chocolatey](chocolatey.org), which is a package manager for Windows. This solution really speeds up the process and creates an nice overview of all the my installations. Another nice feature is that the software is added to PATH automatically.

- [x] Java Developmnet Environment <br>
      I already had a version but installed the newest openJDK at version 14.0.2.
- [x] IntelliJ <br>
      Already installed on my computer.
- [x] Maven <br>
      Installed Apache Maven 3.6.3 .
- [x] Git <br>
      Already have version 2.28.0 installed.
- [x] Heroku-Cli <br>
      Installed Heroku-Cli version 7.42.6.

## Validation
I validated all installations by typing their commands in ``PowerShell``.

## Heroku Platform
No problems encountered with the Heroku platform. I was also successful signing in and depolying the example app from the experiment. In addition I pushed the [app](https://github.com/oddhus/DAT250-Experiment1-javaApp) to my github repository

## Any Pending Issuses
No, not at this moment.
